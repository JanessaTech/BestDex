**[Interviewer]** We know the interation(via rpc calls) between the frontend and blockchain nodes is the one of key root causes of the performance issue and the single point of failure. Please design a system which can optimize the rpc calls to improve the performance and stability for your frontend. Please first think about answer: During the entire lifecycle of interaction between the frontend and blockchain(from page loading to user sending a transaction), which specific scenarios have the frequent, slow , or cirtical rpc calls? Please list 2-3 typical scenarios that you want to optimize.

**[Me]** Retrieving account balance and sending transaction are 2 scenarios I want to optimize.

**[Interviewer]** Tell me more about optimizing rpc calls to retrive account balance
